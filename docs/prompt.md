1. **Prompt summary (short):**  
Generate an MVP description and matching acceptance criteria based on `idee.md`. The output should be saved as `mvp.md` and `acceptance_tests.md`. Focus on a compact, testable foundation for a static, LocalStorage-first web app. Use existing project assumptions (UI-first, zero-cost, JSON export/import). Write in English.

2. **Prompt for pair-programming assistants (`copilot-instructions.md`, `cursor-instruction.md`):**  
Create both files with identical content that brief a pair-programming assistant. Summarise the project goal and MVP, highlight constraints (UI-first, no-cost, LocalStorage-first, no Streamlit), list priorities for pull requests, provide concrete technical guidelines (file structure, modules, priority logic), and define acceptance/QA checks plus onboarding tasks (e.g. skeleton UI, export/import). Keep the tone action-oriented, pragmatic, and focused on the MVP. Include examples for commit messages and minimal implementation steps. Use English throughout.
