# General Rules

## Working Guidelines
1. Review existing tests before implementing changes to understand expected behaviour.
2. Work incrementally; run tests after significant edits.
3. Do **not** overwrite user changes in a dirty worktree.
4. Summarise results clearly in commits/PRs and call out next steps.
5. Update the documentation whenever functionality changes.
6. Raise a PR when work is complete and hand it off for review.
7. **Naming rule:** Use English-only identifiers, function names and terminology across the codebase and documentation.

## Windows Note
On Windows, Cursor should use `cmd` instead of PowerShell for terminal commands. Use `cmd /c <command>` when running commands on Windows.

## Reference Material
- Product expectations: `README.md` and the documents in `docs/`.
- Feature priorities: consult project documents first, then ask if unclear.
